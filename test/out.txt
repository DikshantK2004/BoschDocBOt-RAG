In 2008 the car was stated to be a family car. In 2017 Tesla added that the Standard Range version of the all-electric car would have an estimated EPA-rated range of 215 miles (346 km), a five-passenger seating capacity, front and rear trunks, and promised sports-car levels of acceleration performance. Tesla said it would have a 5-Star safety rating and have a drag coefficient of Cd=0.225. This is lower than the Tesla Model S drag coefficient of Cd=0.24, which, in 2014, was the lowest among the production cars of the time.Within a week of unveiling the Model 3 in 2016, Tesla revealed they had taken 325,000 reservations for the car. These reservations represented potential sales of over US$14 billion. By August 2017, there were 455,000 net reservations.Industry experts were dubious when, in May 2016, Tesla announced its decision to advance its 500,000-total-unit build plan (combined for Model S, Model X, and Model 3) to 2018, two years earlier than previously planned, in order to accelerate its target for Model 3 output. As predicted, there were "production bottlenecks" and "production hell". In May 2016, Tesla issued US$2 billion in new shares to the stock market to finance the plan.The company plans for the Model 3 are part of Tesla\'s three-step strategy to start with a high-price vehicle and move progressively towards lower-cost vehicles, while the battery and electric drivetrain were improved and paid for through the sales of the Roadster, Model S, and Model X vehicles.On April 18, 2018, Tesla updated its production target to 6,000 vehicles per week by the end of June 2018, an increase from its previous target of 5,000 vehicles per week which was previously promised at earlier dates. On July 1, 2018, Elon Musk announced that Tesla had met its production goal of 5,000 cars in a week.On February 28, 2019, Tesla announced the availability of the highly anticipated Standard Range trim priced at $35,000 (equivalent to $40,061 in 2022). However, on April 12, 2019, Tesla announced that the Standard Range model would no longer be available for ordering online, but only over the phone or in stores. Autopilot, previously a $3,000 option, was included in all versions of the Model 3 except for the Standard Range, while each version\'s price only increased by $2,000. In February 2019, the Model 3 passed the Chevrolet Volt to become the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car in the U.S. Model 3 sales surpassed the Nissan Leaf in early 2020 to become the world\'s all-time top selling plug-in electric car.\n\n\n=== Model naming ===\nDuring an interview recorded in 2006 Musk referred to "Model 2" (later Tesla Model S), and to "Model 3".

As of November 2015, Tesla website showed battery-limited combined 345 kilowatts (463 hp) for P85D (397 kilowatts (532 hp) for "Ludicrous"). A lawsuit by 126 owners in Norway was settled in December 2016.\n\n\n=== Power consumption ===\nIn early March 2016, a report by Stuff magazine revealed that a test performed by VICOM, Ltd on behalf of Singapore\'s Land Transport Authority had found a 2014 Tesla Model S to be consuming 444 Wh/km (0.715 kW⋅h/mi), which was greater than the 240 Wh/km (0.38 kW⋅h/mi) reported by EPA and the 181 Wh/km (0.291 kW⋅h/mi) reported by Tesla. As a result, a carbon surcharge was imposed on the Model S, making Singapore the only country in the world to impose an environmental surcharge on a fully electric car. The Land Transport Authority justified this by stating that it had to "account for CO2 emissions during the electricity generation process" and therefore "a grid emission factor of 0.5 g/watt-hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption". Tesla countered that when the energy used to extract, refine, and distribute gasoline was taken into account, the Model S produced approximately one-third the CO2 of an equivalent gasoline-powered vehicle.Later that month, the Land Transport Authority released a statement stating that they and the VICOM Emission Test Laboratory would work with Tesla engineers to determine whether the test was flawed, and a Tesla statement indicated that the discussions were "positive" and that they were confident of a quick resolution.\n\n\n=== Plaid+ reservation issues ===\nAfter it was announced that Plaid+ was canceled, some reservation holders discovered their reservations had been converted into a full order for the regular Plaid version and with no refund included for their Plaid+ deposit.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Model S has received numerous awards, including:\n\n2013 AutoGuide.com Reader\'s Choice Car of the Year\n2013 World Green Car of the Year\nAutomobile Magazine\'s 2013 Car of the Year, a unanimous decision\nCNET Tech Car of the Year for 2012\nConsumer Reports gave the Model S a score of 103 out of 100, its highest ever.

As of November 2015, Tesla website showed battery-limited combined 345 kilowatts (463 hp) for P85D (397 kilowatts (532 hp) for "Ludicrous"). A lawsuit by 126 owners in Norway was settled in December 2016.\n\n\n=== Power consumption ===\nIn early March 2016, a report by Stuff magazine revealed that a test performed by VICOM, Ltd on behalf of Singapore\'s Land Transport Authority had found a 2014 Tesla Model S to be consuming 444 Wh/km (0.715 kW⋅h/mi), which was greater than the 240 Wh/km (0.38 kW⋅h/mi) reported by EPA and the 181 Wh/km (0.291 kW⋅h/mi) reported by Tesla. As a result, a carbon surcharge was imposed on the Model S, making Singapore the only country in the world to impose an environmental surcharge on a fully electric car. The Land Transport Authority justified this by stating that it had to "account for CO2 emissions during the electricity generation process" and therefore "a grid emission factor of 0.5 g/watt-hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption". Tesla countered that when the energy used to extract, refine, and distribute gasoline was taken into account, the Model S produced approximately one-third the CO2 of an equivalent gasoline-powered vehicle.Later that month, the Land Transport Authority released a statement stating that they and the VICOM Emission Test Laboratory would work with Tesla engineers to determine whether the test was flawed, and a Tesla statement indicated that the discussions were "positive" and that they were confident of a quick resolution.\n\n\n=== Plaid+ reservation issues ===\nAfter it was announced that Plaid+ was canceled, some reservation holders discovered their reservations had been converted into a full order for the regular Plaid version and with no refund included for their Plaid+ deposit.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe Model S has received numerous awards, including:\n\n2013 AutoGuide.com Reader\'s Choice Car of the Year\n2013 World Green Car of the Year\nAutomobile Magazine\'s 2013 Car of the Year, a unanimous decision\nCNET Tech Car of the Year for 2012\nConsumer Reports gave the Model S a score of 103 out of 100, its highest ever.

At that time, only two other cars had earned the same recognition since 2011 (when the NHTSA introduced its latest rating scheme).\n\n\n=== Incidents ===\n\n\n==== Initial battery fire incidents ====\nThe first widely reported fire occurred several minutes after the vehicle hit metal debris on the Washington State Route 167 highway on October 1, 2013. The driver "was able to exit the highway as instructed by the onboard alert system, bring the car to a stop and depart the vehicle without injury". He then contacted authorities and, while awaiting their arrival, smoke began coming out the front of the vehicle. The driver stated that he hit something while exiting the HOV lane. Tesla stated that the fire was caused by the "direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 battery modules", and that by design, the modules were separated by firewalls, limiting the fire to "a small section in the front of the vehicle".The module was evidently punctured by a "curved section" that fell off a truck and was recovered near the accident. Tesla stated that the debris punched a 3-inch (76 mm) diameter hole through the .25-inch (6.4 mm) armor plate under the vehicle, applying force of some 25 tons. Built-in vents directed the flames away from the vehicle so that the fire did not enter the passenger compartment. According to Tesla, the firefighters followed standard procedure; using water to extinguish the fire was correct, however, puncturing the metal firewall to gain access to the fire also allowed the flames to spread to the front trunk. Tesla also stated that because the battery pack contains "only about 10% of the energy contained in a gasoline tank", the effective combustion potential of a single module is only about 1% that of a conventional vehicle.NHTSA reported, "After reviewing all available data, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a Tesla Model S was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards." The following month, the NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation to determine "the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 Tesla Model S vehicles". On March 28, 2014, NHTSA closed its investigation, claiming that the (new) titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates, along with increased ground clearance, "should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk".', 'start_char_idx': 31188, 'end_char_idx': 34475, 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'metadata_seperator': '\n'}

As of 2018, the Model S rank fell to second place after the BAIC EC-Series city car, which sold over 78,000 units in China.The Model S continued to rank as the second most-sold electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf. As of December 2018, cumulative global sales totaled about 263,504 units.In 2019, in-year sales of the Model 3 exceeded the total number of the Model S ever sold. By 2021, combined quarterly sales of the Model 3 and Model Y exceeded the total number of the Model S ever sold.\n\n\n=== Sales by country ===\n\n\n==== Asia/Pacific ====\nThe first nine Australian units were delivered in Sydney on December 9, 2014. Tesla opened its first store and service centre in St Leonards, and its first Supercharger station at Pyrmont in December 2014.The Model S was the top selling all-electric car in the country for the first quarter of 2015.The first Chinese deliveries took place on April 22, 2014. The standard equipment was the same as the European version, with larger back seats because the car was expected to be driven by a chauffeur. By mid-2018, China ranked as Tesla’s second largest market. Sales began in Hong Kong in July 2014.\n\n\n==== Europe ====\nEuropean retail deliveries began in August 2013, in Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Europe's first delivery took place in Oslo on August 7, 2013. By the end of August, Europe's first six charging stations opened, in Lyngdal, Aurland, Dombås, Gol, Sundebru and Lillehammer. Sales rose most rapidly in Norway. In April 2014 the Schiphol Group announced that three companies were selected to provide all-electric taxi service in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The Model S topped the European luxury car segment in 2015, ahead of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (14,990), the traditional leader.Sales in 2015 totaled 1,805 units, and declined to 1,693 in 2016. As of October 2016, combined registrations of the Model S (5,681) and the Model X (250) represented 48.6% of the 12,196 all-electric cars on Dutch roads at the end of that month.

As of December 2018, cumulative global sales totaled about 263,504 units.In 2019, in-year sales of the Model 3 exceeded the total number of the Model S ever sold. By 2021, combined quarterly sales of the Model 3 and Model Y exceeded the total number of the Model S ever sold.\n\n\n=== Sales by country ===\n\n\n==== Asia/Pacific ====\nThe first nine Australian units were delivered in Sydney on December 9, 2014. Tesla opened its first store and service centre in St Leonards, and its first Supercharger station at Pyrmont in December 2014.The Model S was the top selling all-electric car in the country for the first quarter of 2015.The first Chinese deliveries took place on April 22, 2014. The standard equipment was the same as the European version, with larger back seats because the car was expected to be driven by a chauffeur. By mid-2018, China ranked as Tesla’s second largest market. Sales began in Hong Kong in July 2014.\n\n\n==== Europe ====\nEuropean retail deliveries began in August 2013, in Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Europe's first delivery took place in Oslo on August 7, 2013. By the end of August, Europe's first six charging stations opened, in Lyngdal, Aurland, Dombås, Gol, Sundebru and Lillehammer. Sales rose most rapidly in Norway. In April 2014 the Schiphol Group announced that three companies were selected to provide all-electric taxi service in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The Model S topped the European luxury car segment in 2015, ahead of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (14,990), the traditional leader.Sales in 2015 totaled 1,805 units, and declined to 1,693 in 2016. As of October 2016, combined registrations of the Model S (5,681) and the Model X (250) represented 48.6% of the 12,196 all-electric cars on Dutch roads at the end of that month.
